                USBD driver

  @section intro_sec Introduction
  USB Device Driver (USBD) falls in USB-LL layer of the MSS USB Driver stack.
  The USBD driver implements the core functionality of the USB Device mode
  operations. The USBD driver is responsible for following functionalities.
    •	USB Device Enumeration
    •	USB Standard request handling
    •	USB Suspend, Resume and Reset handling
    •	Endpoint management
    •	USB transfers management
    •	USBD-Class call-back interface
    •	Application call-back interface

  @section theory_op Theory of Operation
  The following steps are involved in the operation of MSS USB:
    •	Configuration
    •	Initialization
    •	USBD-Class Interface
    •	Application Interface
    •	Data transfer
  USBD driver operation depends on user configuration provided in mss_usb_config.h.
  Configuration
  To operate the MSS USB block in USB Device mode following parameter must be
  defined in the mss_usb_config.h file.

  MSS_USB_PERIPHERAL_MODE  	Configures the MSS USB Driver Stack to operate in USB
  Device mode.
  Initialization
  The USBD driver must be initialized by calling initialization function
  MSS_USBD_init() with a parameter to select Hi-Speed (HS) mode or Full Speed (FS)
  mode. The USB enumeration process is handled internally by this driver.
  Application only needs to provide required application specific information
  (descriptor) by using MSS_USBD_set_desc_cb_handler() and
  MSS_USBD_set_class_cb_handler() functions.

  Note: USB Low speed operation in Device mode is not supported by MSS USB.

  USBD-Class Call-back Interface
  This driver encapsulates the generic USB protocol functionality from the USB
  class functionality. To pass on the control to the USBD-Class driver for
  handling the USB class specific functionality, this driver needs the
  USBD-Class driver to implement a set of call-back functions. This driver
  provides a data type mss_usbd_user_class_cb_t which must be implemented by
  USBD-Class driver. This data type is the collection of call-back functions
  which should be implemented by USBD-Class driver. Implementing all the
  elements of this structure may not be necessary for a specific USB class.
  The USBD-Class driver must define a structure of type mss_usbd_user_class_cb_t
  and implement its required elements. The USBD-Class driver must pass a pointer
  to this structure to USBD driver using MSS_USBD_set_class_cb_handler() function.

  Application Call-back Interface
  Application is required to provide the Device specific descriptors during
  enumeration process, namely; Device descriptor, Device Qualifier descriptor and
  Strings descriptors.

  These functions are elements of data structure of type mss_usbd_user_descr_cb_t.
  This structure must be defined and all the required elements of this structure
  must be implemented in the user application source code. The address of this
  structure must be passed to the USBD Driver using MSS_USBD_set_desc_cb_handler()
  function.

  Data transfer
  USB Device uses ‘Endpoint’ for data transfer. The transmit endpoint and receive
  endpoint need to be configured for their respective configuration parameters
  before using them for data transfer. The functions MSS_USBD_tx_ep_configure()
  and MSS_USBD_rx_ep_configure() should be used to configure transmit endpoint
  and receive endpoint respectively.

  To start data transmission on a transmit endpoint, application should use
  MSS_USBD_tx_ep_write() function. This function prepares the driver to transmit
  data to the Host. However, actual transmission happens on receiving IN packet
  from the USB Host. This function is non-blocking. When the data transmission
  is complete or if there were error during the operation, the USBD-Class driver
  will be informed about it by calling a call-back function. Please refer
  USBD-Class Interface section above for more details.

  To receive data from USB Host, this driver must first be prepared for it.
  Application must use MSS_USBD_rx_ep_read_prepare() function for this purpose.
  This function is non-blocking.  On receiving data or in case of errors during
  this operation the USBD-Class driver will be informed about it by calling a
  call-back function. Please refer USBD-Class Interface section above for more
  details.

  The functions MSS_USBD_tx_ep_stall() or MSS_USBD_rx_ep_stall() should be used
  when USBD-Class driver needs to stall a particular endpoint. The stall condition
  on an endpoint can be cleared using MSS_USBD_rx_ep_clr_error() and
  MSS_USBD_rx_ep_clr_error() functions on respective endpoint.

  Control endpoint is significantly different in its operations compared to a
  transmit endpoint or a receive endpoint. Control endpoint can be used for both
  transmitting data to the Host or receiving data from the Host. To configure and
  perform data transfers over control endpoint, separate functions are provided.
  The MSS_USBD_cep_configure() function should be used to configure the control
  endpoint. MSS_USBD_cep_write() and MSS_USBD_cep_read_prepare() function should
  be used to transmit and receive data over control endpoint respectively.

  Since Control endpoint is shared by the USBD driver and the USBD-Class driver,
  the stall condition on Control endpoint is handled by USBD driver internally.
  The USBD-Class driver must provide meaningful return value in the call-back
  functions related to Control endpoint. Depending on these return values USBD
  driver will appropriately handle the stall condition on Control endpoint.

  @brief MSS_USBD_tx_ep_configure()
    The MSS_USBD_tx_ep_configure() API configures the transmit endpoint with the
    configuration values provided as parameters. After initializing the core,
    this API must be called before any other API for the desired transmit
    endpoint.

    Note:  To provide complete flexibility in configuring the FIFOs, this driver
    does not make any assumptions on the FIFO size and FIFO address. User is
    responsible to make sure that the endpoint FIFO does not overlap with other
    endpoint FIFO space.

  @param ep_num
    The ep_num parameter is the endpoint number which is to be configured.
    The endpoint number must be of type mss_usb_ep_num_t.

  @param fifo_addr
    The fifo_addr parameter is the address of the FIFO in the MSS_USB internal
    RAM. Valid FIFO address values are from 0x00 to 0xFFF8. FIFO Address must
    be multiple of 8. If the value provided is not multiple of 8, then the
    immediate lower value which is multiple of 8 is taken as the FIFO address.
    E.g. If the provided value is 0x09, the actual value taken by driver is 0x08.
    If the provided value is less than 0x08 then FIFO address is taken as 0x00.

  @param fifo_size
    The fifo_size parameter is the endpoint FIFO size in the MSS USB core
    internal RAM. Valid FIFO size values are 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 512, 1024,
    2048, 4096. MSS USB core by default assigns 8 byte FIFO if the FIFO size
    is not configured.

  @param max_pkt_size
    The max_pkt_size parameter is the maximum packet size of the USB transfer
    on this endpoint. This value must be equal to the maximum packet size as
    mentioned in the endpoint descriptor for this endpoint which is used
    during enumeration process.

    Note: This value must be less than or equal to the FIFO size value.

  @param num_usb_pkt
    The num_usb_pkt parameter has different meanings for different types of
    transfers.

    Low bandwidth ISO/interrupt transfers – This parameter must always be ‘1u’.
    This parameter represents the number of packets transferred in one (micro)
    frame.

    High bandwidth ISO transfers – This parameter represents the number of
    packets transferred in one (Micro) frame. In this case, this parameter can
    have a value of 1, 2 or 3. High bandwidth ISO transfers are yet implemented.

    Bulk transfers. – For Bulk transfer this value must always be ‘1u’. This
    parameter will be used with the auto-amalgamation/auto-split feature where
    it indicates number of bulk packets to be auto-amalgamated/auto-split in
    bulk transfer. The auto-amalgamation/auto-split feature is not available
    yet.

  @param dma_enable
    The dma_enable parameter specifies whether or not the internal DMA should
    be used for the data transfer from the provided buffer to the USB FIFO.

  @param dma_channel
    The dma_channel parameter specifies the internal DMA channel to be used
    for the data transfers. DMA channel will be associated with selected
    endpoint. Unique DMA channel must be selected to transfer data on individual
    endpoints. This parameter is ignored when dma_enable parameter indicates
    that the DMA should not be used.

  @param xfr_type
   The xfr_type parameter specifies the type of transfer to be performed on the
   selected endpoint. Except control transfer, all other types of transfers
   (Interrupt, Isochronous, and Bulk) can be selected.

   @param add_zlp
    The add_zlp parameter indicates whether a Zero length packet (ZLP) should be
    sent if the transfer is exact multiple of wMaxPacketSize. This parameter is
    only applicable for Bulk transfers. For all other transfer types this
    parameter is ignored.


  @return
    This function does not return a value.
