  @mainpage SmartFusion2 MSS I2C Bare Metal Driver.

  @section intro_sec Introduction
  The SmartFusion2 microcontroller subsystem (MSS) includes two I2C peripherals
  for serial communication. This driver provides a set of functions for
  controlling the MSS I2Cs as part of a bare metal system where no
  operating system is available.
  These drivers can be adapted for use as part of an operating system, but the
  implementation of the adaptation layer between this driver and the operating
  system's driver model is outside the scope of this driver.
  
  @section hw_dependencies Hardware Flow Dependencies
  The configuration of all features of the MSS I2C peripherals is covered by
  this driver with the exception of the SmartFusion2 IOMUX configuration.
  SmartFusion2 allows multiple non-concurrent uses of some external pins through
  IOMUX configuration. This feature allows optimization of external pin usage by
  assigning external pins for use by either the microcontroller subsystem or the
  FPGA fabric. The MSS I2C serial signals are routed through IOMUXs to the
  SmartFusion2 device external pins. The MSS I2C serial signals may also be
  routed through IOMUXs to the SmartFusion2 FPGA fabric.
  The IOMUXs are configured using the SmartFusion2 MSS configurator tool. You
  must ensure that the MSS I2C peripherals are enabled and configured in the
  SmartFusion2 MSS configurator if you wish to use them. For more information on
  IOMUXs, refer to the IOMUX section of the SmartFusion2 Microcontroller
  Subsystem (MSS) User’s Guide.
  The base address and register addresses and interrupt number assignment for
  the MSS I2C peripherals are defined as constants in the SmartFusion2 CMSIS
  HAL. You must ensure that the latest SmartFusion2 CMSIS HAL is included in the
  project settings of the software tool chain used to build your project and
  that it is generated into your project.
  
  @section theory_op Theory of Operation
  The MSS I2C driver functions are grouped into the following categories:
    - Initialization and configuration functions
    - Interrupt control
    - I2C slave address configuration
    - I2C master operations – functions to handle write, read and write-read
                              transactions
    - I2C slave operations – functions to handle write, read and write-read
                             transactions
    - Mixed master and slave operations
    - SMBus interface configuration and control

    
  Initialization and Configuration
    The MSS I2C driver is initialized through a call to the MSS_I2C_init() function.
    This function takes the MSS I2C's configuration as parameters. The
    MSS_I2C_init() function must be called before any other MSS I2C driver functions
    can be called. The first parameter of the MSS_I2C_init() function is a pointer
    to one of two global data structures used by the driver to store state
    information for each MSS I2C. A pointer to these data structures is also used
    as first parameter to any of the driver functions to identify which MSS I2C
    will be used by the called function. The names of these two data structures
    are g_mss_i2c0 and g_mss_i2c1. Therefore any call to an MSS I2C driver function
    should be of the form MSS_I2C_function_name( &g_mss_i2c0, ... ) or
    MSS_I2C_function_name( &g_mss_i2c1, ... ).
    The MSS_I2C_init() function call for each MSS I2C also takes the I2C serial
    address assigned to the MSS I2C and the serial clock divider to be used to
    generate its I2C clock as configuration parameters.
    
  Interrupt Control
    The MSS I2C driver is interrupt driven and it enables and disables the
    generation of INT interrupts by MSS I2C at various times when it is
    operating. The driver automatically handles MSS I2C interrupts internally,
    including enabling disabling and clearing MSS I2C interrupts in the
    Cortex-M3 interrupt controller when required.
    The function MSS_I2C_register_write_handler() is used to register a write
    handler function with the MSS I2C driver that it calls on completion of an
    I2C write transaction by the MSS I2C slave. It is your responsibility to
    create and register the implementation of this handler function that
    processes or trigger the processing of the received data.
    The SMBSUS and SMBALERT interrupts are related to the SMBus interface and
    are enabled and disabled through I2C_enable_smbus_irq(),
    I2C_disable_smbus_irq() respectively. It is your responsibility to create
    interrupt handler functions in your application to get the desired response
    for the SMBus interrupts.


  I2C Slave Address Configuration
    The SmartFusion MSS I2C can respond to two slave addresses:
      - Slave address 0 - This is the primary address that is used for I2C 
                          transactions. You must configure the slave address
                          during MSS_I2C_init() function call, if the MSS I2C is
                          to operate in slave mode.
      - General call address - The MSS I2C slave can be configured to respond to
                          a broadcast command by a master transmitting the
                          general call address 0x00. Use the MSS_I2C_set_gca()
                          function to enable the slave to respond to the general
                          call address. If the I2C slave is not required to
                          respond to the general call address, disable this
                          address by calling MSS_I2C_clear_gca().
                          
  Transaction Types
    The MSS I2C driver is designed to handle three types of I2C transactions:
      Write transactions
      Read transactions
      Write-read transactions
 
    Write transaction
      The master I2C device initiates a write transaction by sending a START bit as
      soon as the bus becomes free. The START bit is followed by the 7-bit serial
      address of the target slave device followed by the read/write bit indicating
      the direction of the transaction. The slave acknowledges the receipt of its
      address with an acknowledge bit. The master sends data one byte at a time to
      the slave, which must acknowledge the receipt of each byte for the next byte
      to be sent. The master sends a STOP bit to complete the transaction.
      The slave can abort the transaction by replying with a non-acknowledge bit
      instead of an acknowledge bit.
      The application programmer can choose not to send a STOP bit at the end of
      the transaction causing the next transaction to begin with a repeated START bit.
      
    Read transaction
      The master I2C device initiates a read transaction by sending a START bit as
      soon as the bus becomes free. The START bit is followed by the 7-bit serial
      address of the target slave device followed by the read/write bit indicating
      the direction of the transaction. The slave acknowledges the receipt of its
      slave address with an acknowledge bit. The slave sends data one byte at a
      time to the master, which must acknowledge receipt of each byte for the
      next byte to be sent. The master sends a non-acknowledge bit following the
      last byte it wishes to read followed by a STOP bit.
      The application programmer can choose not to send a STOP bit at the end of
      the transaction causing the next transaction to begin with a repeated START bit.
 
    Write-read transaction
      The write-read transaction is a combination of a write transaction immediately
      followed by a read transaction. There is no STOP bit between the write and
      read phases of a write-read transaction. A repeated START bit is sent between
      the write and read phases.
      The write-read transaction is typically used to send a command or offset in the
      write transaction specifying the logical data to be transferred during the read
      phase.
      The application programmer can choose not to send a STOP bit at the end of
      the transaction causing the next transaction to begin with a repeated START bit.

  Master Operations
    The application can use the MSS_I2C_write(), MSS_I2C_read() and
    MSS_I2C_write_read() functions to initiate an I2C bus transaction. The
    application can then wait for the transaction to complete using th
    MSS_I2C_wait_complete() function or poll the status of the I2C transaction
    using the MSS_I2C_get_status() function until it returns a value different
    from MSS_I2C_IN_PROGRESS. The MSS_I2C_system_tick() function can be used to
    set a time base for the MSS_I2C_wait_complete() function’s time out delay.

  Slave Operations
    The configuration of the MSS I2C driver to operate as an I2C slave requires
    the use of the following functions:
       MSS_I2C_set_slave_tx_buffer()
       MSS_I2C_set_slave_rx_buffer()
       MSS_I2C_set_slave_mem_offset_length()
       MSS_I2C_register_write_handler()
       MSS_I2C_enable_slave()
    Use of all functions is not required if the slave I2C does not need to support
    all types of I2C read transactions. The subsequent sections list the functions
    that must be used to support each transaction type. 
    
    Responding to read transactions
      The following functions are used to configure the MSS I2C driver to respond
      to I2C read transactions:
        MSS_I2C_set_slave_tx_buffer()
        MSS_I2C_enable_slave()
      The function MSS_I2C_set_slave_tx_buffer() specifies the data buffer that
      will be transmitted when the I2C slave is the target of an I2C read
      transaction. It is then up to the application to manage the content of that
      buffer to control the data that will be transmitted to the I2C master as a
      result of the read transaction.
      The function MSS_I2C_enable_slave() enables the MSS I2C hardware instance
      to respond to I2C transactions. It must be called after the MSS I2C driver
      has been configured to respond to the required transaction types.

    Responding to write transactions
      The following functions are used to configure the MSS I2C driver to
      respond to I2C write transactions:
        - MSS_I2C_set_slave_rx_buffer()
        - MSS_I2C_register_write_handler()
        - MSS_I2C_enable_slave()
      The function MSS_I2C_set_slave_rx_buffer() specifies the data buffer that
      will be used to store the data received by the I2C slave when it is the
      target an I2C  write transaction.
      The function MSS_I2C_register_write_handler() specifies the handler
      function that must be called on completion of the I2C write transaction.
      It is this handler function that will process or trigger the processing of
      the received data.
      The function MSS_I2C_enable_slave() enables the MSS I2C hardware instance
      to respond to I2C transactions. It must be called after the MSS I2C driver
      has been configured to respond to the required transaction types.
      
    Responding to write-read transactions
      The following functions are used to configure the MSS I2C driver to respond
      to write-read transactions:
        - MSS_I2C_set_slave_tx_buffer()
        - MSS_I2C_set_slave_rx_buffer()
        - MSS_I2C_register_write_handler()
        - MSS_I2C_set_slave_mem_offset_length()
        - MSS_I2C_enable_slave()
      The function MSS_I2C_set_slave_mem_offset_length() specifies the number of
      bytes expected by the I2C slave during the write phase of the write-read
      transaction.
      The function MSS_I2C_set_slave_tx_buffer() specifies the data that will be
      transmitted to the I2C master during the read phase of the write-read
      transaction. The value received by the I2C slave during the write phase of
      the transaction will be used as an index into the transmit buffer
      specified by this function to decide which part of the transmit buffer
      will be transmitted to the I2C master as part of the read phase of the
      write-read transaction.
      The function MSS_I2C_set_slave_rx_buffer() specifies the data buffer that
      will be used to store the data received by the I2C slave during the write
      phase of the write-read transaction. This buffer must be at least large
      enough to accommodate the number of bytes specified through the
      MSS_I2C_set_slave_mem_offset_length() function.
      The function MSS_I2C_register_write_handler() can optionally be used to
      specify a handler function that is called on completion of the write phase
      of the I2C write-read transaction. If a handler function is registered, it
      is responsible for processing the received data in the slave receive
      buffer and populating the slave transmit buffer with the data that will be
      transmitted to the I2C master as part of the read phase of the write-read
      transaction.
      The function MSS_I2C_enable_slave() enables the MSS I2C hardware instance
      to respond to I2C transactions. It must be called after the MSS I2C driver
      has been configured to respond to the required transaction types.

  Mixed Master and Slave Operations
      The MSS I2C device supports mixed master and slave operations. If the MSS
      I2C slave has a transaction in progress and your application attempts to
      begin a master mode transaction, the MSS I2C driver queues the master mode
      transaction until the bus is released and the MSS I2C can switch to master
      mode and acquire the bus. The MSS I2C master then starts the previously
      pended transaction.
      
  SMBus Interface Configuration and Control
    The MSS I2C driver initializes the MSS I2C peripheral’s SMBus interface
    using the MSS_I2C_smbus_init() function. The MSS_I2C_suspend_smbus_slave()
    function is used by the MSS I2C, as an SMBus master, to force slave devices
    on the SMBus to enter their power-down/suspend mode. The
    MSS_I2C_reset_smbus() function is used by the MSS I2C, as an SMBus master,
    to force all devices on the SMBus to reset. The MSS_I2C_set_smsbus_alert()
    function is used by the MSS I2C, as an SMBus slave, to force communication
    with the SMBus master. The I2C_enable_smbus_irq() and
    I2C_disable_smbus_irq() functions are used to enable and disable the MSS
    I2C’s SMBSUS and SMBALERT SMBus interrupts.

  Slave write handler functions prototype.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
  This defines the function prototype that must be followed by MSS I2C slave
  write handler functions. These functions are registered with the MSS I2C driver
  through the MSS_I2C_register_write_handler() function.
  
  Declaring and Implementing Slave Write Handler Functions:
    Slave write handler functions should follow the following prototype:
    mss_i2c_slave_handler_ret_t write_handler
    (
        mss_i2c_instance_t *instance, uint8_t * data, uint16_t size
    );
    The instance parameter is a pointer to mss_i2c_instance_t for which this
    slave write handler has been declared.
    The data parameter is a pointer to a buffer (received data buffer) holding
    the data written to the MSS I2C slave.
    The size parameter is the number of bytes held in the received data buffer.
    Handler functions must return one of the following values:
        MSS_I2C_REENABLE_SLAVE_RX
        MSS_I2C_PAUSE_SLAVE_RX.
    If the handler function returns MSS_I2C_REENABLE_SLAVE_RX, the driver
    releases the received data buffer and allows further I2C write transactions
    to the MSS I2C slave to take place.
    If the handler function returns MSS_I2C_PAUSE_SLAVE_RX, the MSS I2C slave
    responds to subsequent write requests with a non-acknowledge bit (NACK),
    until the received data buffer content has been processed by some other part
    of the software application.
    A call to MSS_I2C_enable_slave() is required at some point after
    returning MSS_I2C_PAUSE_SLAVE_RX in order to release the received data
    buffer so it can be used to store data received by subsequent I2C write
    transactions.

    providing any value to this parameter does not have any effect. If you do
    not intend to use the I2C device in slave mode, then any dummy slave address
    value can be provided to this parameter. However, in case of MSS I2C device
    switching from master to slave, it is advisable to initialize the MSS I2C
    device with configured serial slave address. You need to call the
    MSS_I2C_init() function whenever it requires to change the slave address as
    there is no separate function to set slave address of I2C device.

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------*//**
  I2C master write function.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This function initiates an I2C master write transaction. This function returns
  immediately after initiating the transaction. The content of the write buffer
  passed as parameter should not be modified until the write transaction
  completes. It also means that the memory allocated for the write buffer should
  not be freed or should not go out of scope before the write completes.
  You can check for the write transaction completion using the MSS_I2C_status()
  function.

  @param this_i2c:
    The this_i2c parameter is a pointer to an mss_i2c_instance_t structure
    identifying the MSS I2C hardware block that performs the requested function.
    There are two such data structures, g_mss_i2c0 and g_mss_i2c1, associated
    with MSS I2C 0 and MSS I2C 1 respectively. This parameter must point to
    either the g_mss_i2c0 or the g_mss_i2c1 global data structure defined
    within the I2C driver.
  
  @param serial_addr:
    This parameter specifies the serial address of the target I2C device.
  
  @param write_buffer:
    This parameter is a pointer to a buffer holding the data to be written to
    the target I2C device.
    Care must be taken not to release the memory used by this buffer before the
    write transaction completes. For example, it is not appropriate to return
    from a function allocating this buffer as an array variable before the write
    transaction completes as this would result in the buffer's memory being
    de-allocated from the stack when the function returns. This memory could
    then be subsequently reused and modified causing unexpected data to be
    written to the target I2C device.
  
  @param write_size:
    Number of bytes held in the write_buffer to be written to the target I2C
    device.
 
 @param options:
    The options parameter is used to indicate if the I2C bus should be released
    on completion of the write transaction. Using the MSS_I2C_RELEASE_BUS
    constant for the options parameter causes a STOP bit to be generated at the
    end of the write transaction causing the bus to be released for other I2C
    devices to use. Using the MSS_I2C_HOLD_BUS constant as options parameter
    prevents a STOP bit from being generated at the end of the write

  @param read_buffer
    This is pointer to a buffer where the data received from the target device will
    be stored.
    Care must be taken not to release the memory used by this buffer before the
    read transaction completes. For example, it is not appropriate to return
    from a function allocating this buffer as an array variable before the read
    transaction completes as this would result in the buffer's memory being
    de-allocated from the stack when the function returns. This memory could
    then be subsequently reallocated resulting in the read transaction
    corrupting the newly allocated memory. 

  @param read_size:
    This parameter is the number of bytes to read from the target device. This

  @param addr_offset:
    This parameter is a pointer to the buffer containing the data that will be
    sent to the slave during the write phase of the write-read transaction. This
    data is typically used to specify an address offset specifying to the I2C
    slave device what data it must return during the read phase of the
    write-read transaction.
  
  @param offset_size:
    This parameter specifies the number of offset bytes to be written during the
    write phase of the write-read transaction. This is typically the size of the

    either the g_mss_i2c0 or the g_mss_i2c1 global data structure defined
    within the I2C driver.
  @param timeout_ms:
    The timeout_ms parameter specifies the delay within which the current I2C
    transaction is expected to complete. The time out delay is given in
    milliseconds. The MSS_I2C_wait_complete() function returns MSS_I2C_TIMED_OUT
    if the current transaction does not complete before the time out delay
    expires.
    Alternatively, the timeout_ms parameter can be set to MSS_I2C_NO_TIMEOUT to
    indicate that the MSS_I2C_wait_complete() function must not time out.
    Note: If you set the timeout_ms parameter to a value other than
          MSS_I2C_NO_TIMEOUT, you must call the MSS_I2C_system_tick() function
          from an implementation of the Cortex-M3 SysTick timer interrupt
          service routine – SysTick_Handler() – in your application. Otherwise

/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------*//**
  Time out delay expiration.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This function is used to control the expiration of the time out delay
  specified as a parameter to the I2C_wait_complete() function. It must be
  called from the interrupt service routine of a periodic interrupt source such
  as the Cortex-M3 SysTick timer interrupt. It takes the period of the interrupt
  source as its ms_since_last_tick parameter and uses it as the time base for
  the I2C_wait_complete() function’s time out delay.
  Note: This function does not need to be called if the I2C_wait_complete()
        function is called with a timeout_ms value of MSS_I2C_NO_TIMEOUT.
  Note: If this function is not called then the MSS_I2C_wait_complete() function

  @param ms_since_last_tick:
    The ms_since_last_tick parameter specifies the number of milliseconds that
