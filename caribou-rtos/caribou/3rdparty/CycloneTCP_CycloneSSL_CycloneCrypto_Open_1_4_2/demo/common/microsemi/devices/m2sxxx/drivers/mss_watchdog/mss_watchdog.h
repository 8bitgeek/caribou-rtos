  @section intro_sec Introduction
  The SmartFusion2™ microcontroller subsystem (MSS) includes a watchdog timer
  used to detect system lockups. This software driver provides a set of
  functions for controlling the MSS watchdog as part of a bare metal system
  where no operating system is available. The driver can be adapted for use as
  part of an operating system, but the implementation of the adaptation layer
  between the driver and the operating system's driver model is outside the
  scope of the driver.
  
  The MSS watchdog driver provides support for the following features:
    - Initialization of the MSS watchdog
    - Reading the current value and status of the watchdog timer
    - Refreshing the watchdog timer value
    - Enabling, disabling and clearing time-out and wake-up interrupts.
    
  @section hw_dependencies Hardware Flow Dependencies
  The MSS watchdog must be configured by the SmartFusion2 MSS configurator in
  the Libero hardware flow before using this driver in a firmware project. The
  MSS configurator is responsible for the configuration of the MSS watchdog's
  mode of operation, reload value and refresh window. The MSS configurator sets
  the power-on reset state of the system registers that control the
  configuration of the MSS watchdog.
  The MSS watchdog configuration options are as follows:
    - Enable or disable the watchdog after a power-on or system reset
    - Generate a system reset or an interrupt if a watchdog counter timeout
      occurs
    - Set the reload value. This is the value that is loaded into the watchdog
      counter when it is refreshed
    - Set the counter threshold value. This sets up permitted and forbidden
      refresh windows for the watchdog counter
    - Lock the system register controlling watchdog enable/disable and timeout
      mode to the selected configuration (read-only) or allow it to be modified
      by firmware
  This driver assumes that the Libero hardware flow enables the MSS watchdog,
  selects its timeout mode and locks the system register that controls the
  configuration of the MSS watchdog. If you want to have firmware control of
  the MSS watchdog enable/disable and its timeout mode, you must ensure that
  the MSS configurator allows read-write access to the system register that
  controls the configuration of the MSS watchdog. The driver does not provide
  functions to write to this system register.
  The base address, register addresses and interrupt number assignment for the
  MSS watchdog block are defined as constants in the SmartFusion2 CMSIS HAL. You
  must ensure that the latest SmartFusion2 CMSIS HAL is included in the project
  settings of the software tool chain used to build your project and that it is
  generated into your project.
  
  @section theory_op Theory of Operation
  The MSS watchdog driver functions are grouped into the following categories:
    - Initialization  and configuration
    - Reading the current value and status of the watchdog timer
    - Refreshing the watchdog timer value
    - Support for enabling, disabling and clearing time-out and wake-up interrupts.
    
  Initialization and Configuration
  The MSS configurator in the Libero hardware flow is responsible for the
  configuration of the MSS watchdog's mode of operation, reload value and
  refresh window. It configures the watchdog to generate an interrupt or a
  system reset when its counter times out. It also configures the MSS watchdog
  to be enabled or disabled when power-on reset is deasserted.
  Note: The MSS watchdog cannot be enabled or disabled by the driver.
  The MSS watchdog driver is initialized through a call to the MSS_WD_init()
  function. The MSS_WD_init() function must be called before any other watchdog
  driver functions can be called.
  The occurrence of a time out event before the last system reset can be
  detected through the use of the MSS_WD_timeout_occured() function. This
  function would be typically used at the start of the application to detect
  whether the application is starting as a result of a power-on reset or a
  watchdog reset. The time out event must be cleared through a call to function
  MSS_WD_clear_timeout_event() in order to allow the detection of subsequent
  time out events or differentiating between a Cortex-M3 initiated system reset
  and watchdog reset.

  Reading the Watchdog Timer Value and Status
  The current value of the watchdog timer can be read using the
  MSS_WD_current_value() function. The watchdog status can be read using the
  MSS_WD_status() function. These functions are typically required when using
  the watchdog configured with a permitted refresh window to check whether a
  watchdog reload is currently allowed. When the current value of the watchdog
  timer is greater than the permitted refresh window value, refreshing the
  watchdog is forbidden. Attempting to refresh the watchdog timer in the
  forbidden window will cause a reset or interrupt, depending on the watchdog
  configuration. The forbidden refresh window can be disabled by the MSS
  configurator in the hardware flow by specifying a permitted refresh window
  value equal to or higher than the watchdog reload value.
  
  Refreshing the Watchdog Timer Value
  The watchdog timer value is refreshed using the MSS_WD_reload() function. The
  value reloaded into the watchdog timer down-counter is specified in the Libero
  hardware flow using the MSS configurator.

  Interrupt Control
  The watchdog timer can generate interrupts instead of resetting the system
  when its down counter timer expires. The MSS watchdog driver provides the
  following functions to control timeout interrupts:
    - MSS_WD_enable_timeout_irq
    - MSS_WD_disable_timeout_irq
    - MSS_WD_clear_timeout_irq
  The watchdog timer is external to the Cortex-M3 processor core and operates
  even when the Cortex-M3 is in sleep mode. A wakeup interrupt can be generated
  by the watchdog timer to wake up the Cortex-M3 when the watchdog timer value
  reaches the permitted refresh window while the Cortex-M3 is in sleep mode. The
  MSS watchdog driver provides the following functions to control wakeup
  interrupts:
    - MSS_WD_enable_wakeup_irq
    - MSS_WD_disable_wakeup_irq
    - MSS_WD_clear_wakeup_irq
