  @mainpage Smartfusion2 MSS USB Driver Stack 
                    USBD-HID class driver
                
  @section intro_sec Introduction
  The Human Interface Device Class driver implements the USB HID class 
  functionality specified by USB-IF. This driver supports HID mouse functionality.
  To implement this functionality, USB control transfers and Interrupt transfers 
  are used. With this driver, when connected to USB host, the Smartfusion2 device
  appears as a Human interface class Mouse device. This driver can be extended to
  be used for other HID class functionalities. 

  This driver uses USBD-Class driver template to implement HID class.

  
  @section theory_op Theory of Operation   
  The following steps are involved in the operation of MSS USB:
        •	Configuration
        •	Initialization
        •	Enumeration
        •	Class Specific requests
        •	data transfer
  Configuration
  To use this driver, the MSS USB Driver stack must first be configured in USB 
  Device mode using the MSS_USB_PERIPHERAL_MODE constant. No other configuration 
  is necessary.

  Initialization
  HID class driver must be initialized using MSS_USBD_HID_init() function. Once 
  initialized, this driver will get configured by USBD driver during the process
  of Enumeration. The Call-back function MSS_USBD_HID_Init_cb() is implemented by
  this driver which will be called by USBD driver when Host configures this device.
  The MSS_USBD_HID_get_descriptor() is implemented to provide class specific 
  descriptor table to the USBD driver.

  For successful enumeration as a HID class device, this driver defines descriptor
  table which contains a configuration descriptor, a Interface descriptor, a HID 
  class descriptor and an Interrupt IN endpoint descriptor.

  Note:	For successful enumeration, device specific descriptors must be provided 
  by application using MSS_USB_device_set_desc_cb_handler() function to the USBD 
  driver. Since device, string descriptors etc. are not specific to a USB class
  they are not part of HID Class driver.

  Class Specific requests 
  The requests specific to HID Class are handled internally by this driver. 
  The call-back function MSS_USBD_HID_process_request_cb(), is implemented by 
  this driver which processes the HID class specific requests.

  Data transfer
  This driver only needs to perform USB IN transfers on the Interrupt endpoint. 
  The period at which this transfer is repeated is defined by the endpoint 
  descriptor during enumeration process. Application must use 
  MSS_USBD_HID_tx_report() function to provide the report to be transmitted. 
  To know if the previously provided report is transmitted over USB, application
  can use the MSS_USBD_HID_tx_done() function. This driver implements 
  MSS_USBD_HID_tx_data_in_cb()  function which will be called by USBD driver 
  when the data transfers is complete.
