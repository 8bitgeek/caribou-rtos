  @mainpage SmartFusion MSS UART Bare Metal Driver.

  @section intro_sec Introduction
  The SmartFusion™ microcontroller subsystem (MSS) includes two UART peripherals
  for serial communication. This driver provides a set of functions for
  controlling the MSS UARTs as part of a bare metal system where no operating
  system is available. These drivers can be adapted for use as part of an
  operating system, but the implementation of the adaptation layer between
  this driver and the operating system's driver model is outside the scope
  of this driver.

  @section hw_dependencies Hardware Flow Dependencies
  The configuration of all features of the MSS UARTs is covered by this driver
  with the exception of the SmartFusion IOMUX configuration. SmartFusion allows
  multiple non-concurrent uses of some external pins through IOMUX configuration.
  This feature allows optimization of external pin usage by assigning external
  pins for use by either the microcontroller subsystem or the FPGA fabric.
  The MSS UARTs serial signals are routed through IOMUXes to the SmartFusion
  device external pins. These IOMUXes are configured automatically by the
  MSS configurator tool in the hardware flow correctly when the MSS UARTs are
  enabled in that tool. You must ensure that the MSS UARTs are enabled by the
  MSS configurator tool in the hardware flow; otherwise the serial inputs and
  outputs will not be connected to the chip's external pins. For more information
  on IOMUX, refer to the IOMUX section of the SmartFusion Datasheet.
  The base address, register addresses, and interrupt number assignment for the
  MSS UART blocks are defined as constants in the SmartFusion CMSIS-PAL You must
  ensure that the SmartFusion CMSIS-PAL is either included in the software tool
  chain used to build your project or is included in your project.

  @section theory_op Theory of Operation
  The MSS UART driver functions are logically grouped into three groups:
    - Initialization and configuration functions
    - Polled transmit and receive functions
    - Interrupt driven transmit and receive functions

  Initialization and Configuration
  The MSS UART driver is initialized through a call to the MSS_UART_init()
  function. This function takes the UART’s configuration as parameters.
  The MSS_UART_init() function must be called before any other MSS UART
  driver functions can be called. The first parameter of the MSS_UART_init()
  function is a pointer to one of two global data structures used to store
  state information for each MSS UART. A pointer to these data structures
  is also used as the first parameter to any of the driver functions to
  identify which MSS UART will be used by the called function. The names
  of these two data structures are g_mss_uart0 and g_mss_uart1. Therefore,
  any call to an MSS UART function should be of the form
  MSS_UART_function_name( &g_mss_uart0, ... ) or
  MSS_UART_function_name( &g_mss_uart1, ... ).

  Polled Transmit and Receive Operations
  The driver can be used to transmit and receive data once initialized.
  Polled operations where the driver constantly polls the state of the UART
  registers in order to control data transmit or data receive are performed
  using these functions:
  • MSS_UART_polled_tx()
  • MSS_UART_polled_tx_string
  • MSS_UART_fill_tx_fifo()
  • MSS_UART_get_rx()
  Data is transmitted using the MSS_UART_polled_tx() function. This function
  is blocking, meaning that it will only return once the data passed to the
  function has been sent to the MSS UART hardware transmitter. Data received
  by the MSS UART hardware receiver can be read by the MSS_UART_get_rx() function.
  The MSS_UART_polled_tx_string() function is provided to transmit a NULL (‘\0’)
  terminated string in polled mode. This function is blocking, meaning that it
  will only return once the data passed to the function has been sent to the
  MSS UART hardware transmitter.
  The MSS_UART_fill_tx_fifo() function fills the MSS UART hardware transmit FIFO
  with data from a buffer passed as a parameter and returns the number of bytes
  transferred to the FIFO. If the transmit FIFO is not empty when the
  MSS_UART_fill_tx_fifo() function is called it returns immediately without
  transferring any data to the FIFO.

  Interrupt Driven Operations
  The driver can also transmit or receive data under interrupt control, freeing
  your application to perform other tasks until an interrupt occurs indicating
  that the driver’s attention is required. Interrupt controlled UART operations
  are performed using these functions:
  • MSS_UART_irq_tx()
  • MSS_UART_tx_complete()
  • MSS_UART_set_tx_handler()
  • MSS_UART_set_rx_handler()
  • MSS_UART_set_rxstatus_handler()
  • MSS_UART_set_modemstatus_handler()
  • MSS_UART_enable_irq()
  • MSS_UART_disable_irq()

  Interrupt Handlers
  The MSS UART driver supports all types of interrupt triggered by the MSS UART.
  The driver’s internal top level interrupt handler identifies the source of the
  MSS UART interrupt and calls the corresponding lower level handler function
  that you previously registered with the driver through calls to the
  MSS_UART_set_rx_handler(), MSS_UART_set_tx_handler(),
  MSS_UART_set_rxstatus_handler(), and MSS_UART_set_modemstatus_handler() functions.
  You are responsible for creating these lower level interrupt handlers as part of
  your application program and registering them with the driver.
  Note:     The SmartFusion CMSIS-PAL defines the UART0_IRQHandler() and
  UART1_IRQHandler() functions (with weak linkage) and assigns them as the
  interrupt service routines (ISR) for the MSS UART interrupt inputs to the
  Cortex-M1 NVIC. The MSS UART driver provides the implementation functions for
  both of these ISRs from which it calls its own internal top level, interrupt
  handler function. The ISRs also clear the MSS UART interrupt in the NVIC before
  returning to prevent the same interrupt event retriggering a call to the ISR.
  The MSS_UART_enable_irq() and MSS_UART_disable_irq() functions are used to
  enable or disable the received line status, received data available/character
  timeout, transmit holding register empty and modem status interrupts at the
  MSS UART level. The MSS_UART_enable_irq() function also enables the MSS UART
  instance interrupt at the Cortex-M3 level.

  Transmitting Data
  Interrupt-driven transmit is initiated by a call to MSS_UART_irq_tx(),
  specifying the block of data to transmit. Your application is then free to
  perform other tasks and inquire later whether transmit has completed by calling
  the MSS_UART_tx_complete() function. The MSS_UART_irq_tx() function enables
  the UART’s transmit holding register empty (THRE) interrupt and then, when
  the interrupt goes active, the driver’s default THRE interrupt handler transfers
  the data block to the UART until the entire block is transmitted.

  Note:     You can use the MSS_UART_set_tx_handler() function to assign an
  alternative handler to the THRE interrupt. In this case, you must not use
  the MSS_UART_irq_tx() function to initiate the transmit, as this will
  re-assign the driver’s default THRE interrupt handler to the THRE interrupt.
  Instead, your alternative THRE interrupt handler must include a call to
  the MSS_UART_fill_tx_fifo() function to transfer the data to the UART.

  Receiving Data
  Interrupt-driven receive is performed by first calling MSS_UART_set_rx_handler()
  to register a receive handler function that will be called by the driver
  whenever receive data is available. You must provide this receive handler
  function which must include a call to the MSS_UART_get_rx() function to
  actually read the received data.

  UART Status
  The function MSS_UART_get_rx_status() is used to read the receiver error status.
  This function returns the overrun, parity, framing, break, and FIFO error status
  of the receiver.
  The function MSS_UART_get_tx_status() is used to read the transmitter status.
  This function returns the transmit empty (TEMT) and transmit holding register
  empty (THRE) status of the transmitter.
  The function MSS_UART_get_modem_status() is used to read the modem status flags.
  This function returns the current value of the modem status register.

  Loopback
  The MSS_UART_set_loopback() function can be used to locally loopback the Tx and
  Rx lines of a UART. This is not to be confused with the loopback of UART0 to
  UART1, which can be achieved through the microcontroller subsystem’s system
  registers.

  buffer once this function returns.

  Note:     This function reads the UART’s line status register (LSR) to poll
  for the active state of the transmitter holding register empty (THRE) bit
  before transferring data from the data buffer to the transmitter FIFO. It
  transfers data to the transmitter FIFO in blocks of 16 bytes or less and
  allows the FIFO to empty before transferring the next block of data.

  in progress when this function returns. Use the MSS_UART_get_tx_status()
  function if you need to know when the transmitter is empty.

  @param this_uart
    The this_uart parameter is a pointer to an mss_uart_instance_t

  The function MSS_UART_irq_tx() is used to initiate an interrupt-driven
  transmit. It returns immediately after making a note of the transmit buffer
  location and enabling transmit interrupts both at the UART and Cortex-M3 NVIC
  level. This function takes a pointer via the pbuff parameter to a memory
  buffer containing the data to transmit. The memory buffer specified through
  this pointer must remain allocated and contain the data to transmit until
  the transmit completion has been detected through calls to function
  MSS_UART_tx_complete(). The actual transmission over the serial connection
  is still in progress until calls to the MSS_UART_tx_complete() function
  indicate transmit completion.

  Note:     The MSS_UART_irq_tx() function enables both the transmit holding
  register empty (THRE) interrupt in the UART and the MSS UART instance
  interrupt in the Cortex-M3 NVIC as part of its implementation.

  Note:     The MSS_UART_irq_tx() function assigns an internal default transmit
  interrupt handler function to the UART’s THRE interrupt. This interrupt
  handler overrides any custom interrupt handler that you may have previously
  registered using the MSS_UART_set_tx_handler() function.

  Note:     The MSS_UART_irq_tx() function’s default transmit interrupt
  handler disables the UART’s THRE interrupt when all of the data has
  been transferred to the UART's transmit FIFO.

  The MSS_UART_get_rx() function reads the content of the UART receiver’s FIFO
  and stores it in the receive buffer that is passed via the rx_buff function
  parameter. It copies either the full contents of the FIFO into the receive
  buffer, or just enough data from the FIFO to fill the receive buffer,
  dependent upon the size of the receive buffer passed by the buff_size
  parameter. The MSS_UART_get_rx() function returns the number of bytes copied
  into the receive buffer .This function is non-blocking and will return 0
  immediately if no data has been received.

  Note:     The MSS_UART_get_rx() function reads and accumulates the receiver
  status of the MSS UART instance before reading each byte from the receiver's
  data register/FIFO. This allows the driver to maintain a sticky record of any
  receiver errors that occur as the UART receives each data byte; receiver
  errors would otherwise be lost after each read from the receiver's data register.
  A call to the MSS_UART_get_rx_status() function returns any receiver errors
  accumulated during the execution of the MSS_UART_get_rx() function.

  Note:     If you need to read the error status for each byte received, set
  the buff_size to 1 and read the receive line error status for each byte
  using the MSS_UART_get_rx_status() function.
  The MSS_UART_get_rx() function can be used in polled mode, where it is called
  at regular intervals to find out if any data has been received, or in interrupt
  driven-mode, where it is called as part of a receive handler that is called
  by the driver as a result of data being received.

  Note:     In interrupt driven mode you should call the MSS_UART_get_rx()
  function as part of the receive handler function that you register with
  the MSS UART driver through a call to MSS_UART_set_rx_handler().

/***************************************************************************//**
  The MSS_UART_fill_tx_fifo() function fills the UART's hardware transmitter
  FIFO with the data found in the transmitter buffer that is passed via the
  tx_buffer function parameter. If the transmitter FIFO is not empty when
  the function is called, the function returns immediately without transferring
  any data to the FIFO; otherwise, the function transfers data from the
  transmitter buffer to the FIFO until it is full or until the complete
  contents of the transmitter buffer have been copied into the FIFO. The
  function returns the number of bytes copied into the UART's transmitter FIFO.

  Note:     This function reads the UART’s line status register (LSR) to check
  for the active state of the transmitter holding register empty (THRE) bit
  before transferring data from the data buffer to the transmitter FIFO. If
  THRE is 0, the function returns immediately, without transferring any data
  to the FIFO. If THRE is 1, the function transfers up to 16 bytes of data
  to the FIFO and then returns.

  Note:     The actual transmission over the serial connection will still be
  in progress when this function returns. Use the MSS_UART_get_tx_status()
  function if you need to know when the transmitter is empty.

  @param this_uart
    The this_uart parameter is a pointer to an mss_uart_instance_t
    structure identifying the MSS UART hardware block that will perform
    the requested function. There are two such data structures,
    g_mss_uart0 and g_mss_uart1, associated with MSS UART0 and MSS UART1.
    This parameter must point to either the g_mss_uart0 or g_mss_uart1
    global data structure defined within the UART driver.

  @param tx_buffer
    The tx_buffer parameter is a pointer to a buffer containing the data
    to be transmitted.

  The MSS_UART_get_rx_status() function returns the receiver error status of the
  MSS UART instance. It reads both the current error status of the receiver from
  the UART’s line status register (LSR) and the accumulated error status from
  preceding calls to the MSS_UART_get_rx() function, and it combines them using
  a bitwise OR. It returns the cumulative overrun, parity, framing, break and
  FIFO error status of the receiver, since the previous call to
  MSS_UART_get_rx_status(), as an 8-bit encoded value.

  Note:     The MSS_UART_get_rx() function reads and accumulates the receiver
  status of the MSS UART instance before reading each byte from the receiver’s
  data register/FIFO. The driver maintains a sticky record of the cumulative
  receiver error status, which persists after the MSS_UART_get_rx() function
  returns. The MSS_UART_get_rx_status() function clears the driver’s sticky
  receiver error record before returning.

  Note:     The driver’s transmit functions also read the line status
  register (LSR) as part of their implementation. When the driver reads the
  LSR, the UART clears any active receiver error bits in the LSR. This could
  result in the driver losing receiver errors. To avoid any loss of receiver
  errors, the transmit functions also update the driver’s sticky record of the
  cumulative receiver error status whenever they read the LSR.
