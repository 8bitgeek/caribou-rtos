 * This function performas the various operations on the serial Flash 
 * bassed on the command passed as first perameter.
 * The operatins of the each command is explained below.
 *
 * @param operation 
 *        The operations supported are as per the enum spi_flash_control_hw_t
 *        defined above. The functionality is as fllows:
 * 
 *        1. SPI_FLASH_SECTOR_UNPROTECT: Every 64KBytes are represented
 *           in sectors. There is a corresponding bits set for protection
 *           of that sector. To do modify operations like write and erase
 *           we need to call this operation to unprotect the block.
 *           The second perapeter 'peram1' for this function is the block
 *           address to unprotect.
 * 
 *        2. SPI_FLASH_SECTOR_PROTECT :  Every 64KBytes are represented
 *           in sectors. There is a corresponding bits set for protection
 *           of that sector. To protect from the modify operations like
 *           write and erase we need to call this operation
 *           to protect the block. The second perapeter 'peram1' for this 
 *           function is the block address to protect.
 * 
 *        3. SPI_FLASH_GLOBAL_UNPROTECT: This command is used to unprotect
 *           the entire flash for modify operations.
 * 
 *        4. SPI_FLASH_GLOBAL_PROTECT: This command is used to protect/lock
 *           the entire flash from modify operations.
 * 
 *        5. SPI_FLASH_GET_STATUS: This function used to get the SPI Flash
 *           status register content for more details of the status bits
 *           refer the page36 of flash data sheet AT25DF641.
 * 
 *        6. SPI_FLASH_4KBLOCK_ERASE: This command is used to erase the block
 *           startig at 4KB boundary. The starting address of the 4K Block is
 *           passed in the second perameter peram1 of this API.
 * 
 *        7. SPI_FLASH_32KBLOCK_ERASE: This command is used to erase the block
 *           startig at 32KB boundary. The starting address of the 32K Block
 *           is passed in the second perameter peram1 of this API.
 * 
 *        8. SPI_FLASH_64KBLOCK_ERASE: This command is used to erase the block
 *           startig at 64KB boundary. The starting address of the 64K Block
 *           is passed in the second perameter peram1 of this API.
 * 
 *        9. SPI_FLASH_CHIP_ERASE This command is used to erase the entire flash chip.
 * 
 *        10. SPI_FLASH_READ_DEVICE_ID: This command is used to read the
 *            device properties. The values are filled in the third perameter
 *            'ptrPeram' of this API,
 * 
 *        11. SPI_FLASH_RESET: In some cases it may be necessary to prematurely terminate
 *            a program or erase cycle early rather than wait the hundreds of microseconds or
 *            milliseconds necessary for the program or erase opeation to complete normally.
 *            The Reset command allows a program or erase operation in progress to be ended
 *            abruptly and returns the deviceto an idle state. 
 *                      
 * @param peram1        The peram1 usage is explained in the above descriptio according
 *                      to command in use.
 * @param ptrPeram      The ptrPeram usage is explained in the above descriptio according
 *                      to command in use.
 * @return              The return value indicates if the write was successful.
 *                      Possible values are:
 *                      SPI_FLASH_SUCCESS,
 *                      SPI_FLASH_PROTECTION_ERROR,

 * 
 *                      SPI_FLASH_PROTECTION_ERROR: The sector is under protedted and
 *                      not allowing the operation.
 *                      We need to do the unprotect and do the operation
