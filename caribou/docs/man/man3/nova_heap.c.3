.SS "void* nova_heap_calloc (size_tnmemb, size_tsize)"
The \fBcalloc()\fP function allocates memory for an array of nmemb elements of size bytes each and returns a pointer to the allocated memory\&. The memory is set to zero\&. If nmemb or size is 0, then \fBcalloc()\fP returns either NULL, or a unique pointer value that can later be successfully passed to \fBfree()\fP\&.

Definition at line 43 of file nova_heap\&.c\&.
.SS "void nova_heap_free (void *addr)"
\fBfree()\fP frees the memory space pointed to by ptr, which must have been returned by a previous call to \fBmalloc()\fP or \fBrealloc()\fP\&. Otherwise, or if free(ptr) has already been called before, undefined behavior occurs\&. If ptr is NULL, no opera‐ tion is performed\&.

Definition at line 31 of file nova_heap\&.c\&.
.SS "void* nova_heap_malloc (size_tsize)"
\fBmalloc()\fP allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to the allocated memory\&. The memory is not cleared\&. If size is 0, then \fBmalloc()\fP returns either NULL, or a unique pointer value that can later be successfully passed to \fBfree()\fP\&. 
.PP
Definition at line 53 of file nova_heap\&.c\&.
.SS "void* nova_heap_realloc (void *p, size_tsize)"
\fBrealloc()\fP changes the size of the memory block pointed to by ptr to size bytes\&. The contents will be unchanged to the minimum of the old and new sizes; newly allocated memory will be uninitialized\&. If ptr is NULL, then the call is equivalent to mal‐ loc(size), for all values of size; if size is equal to zero, and ptr is not NULL, then the call is equivalent to free(ptr)\&. Unless ptr is NULL, it must have been returned by an earlier call to \fBmalloc()\fP or \fBrealloc()\fP\&. If the area pointed to was moved, a free(ptr) is done\&.
